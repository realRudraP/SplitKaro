## üíª Technical Details

### Built With
- HTML5
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [IDB Wrapper](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb) for IndexedDB interactions

### Data Architecture

#### Transaction Structure
```javascript
{
    transactionID: uuidv4(),
    eventID: eventID,
    transacationName: transactionName,
    payerName: payerName,
    payerID: payerID,
    amount: float,
    payees: payeeAmounts,
    commonCharges: float,
    timestamp: Date.now()
}
```

#### Trip Structure
```javascript
{
    id: uuidv4(),
    name: tripName,
    date: tripDate,
    participants: participants,
    totalAmountSpent: 0
}
```

### Debt Management System
SplitKaro implements an efficient debt tracking system that maintains individual debt records between participants. The system uses caching to optimize performance, updating debt calculations only when new transactions are detected. This approach provides quick access to debt information while minimizing computational overhead.
